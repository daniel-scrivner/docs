Here's a riddle: Nobody I've ever worked with likes micromanagement. Yet, on every team I've been on, there is at least one micromanager. How is this possible?

_Harvard Business Review_ says, "[<u>Micromanage at Your Peril.</u>](https://hbr.org/2008/02/micromanage-at-your-peril.html)" _Forbes_ says "[<u>Micromanaging is one of the most damaging habits an executive can have</u>](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/05/19/micromanaging-heres-how-and-why-you-should-stop/?sh=5d9b4d4c7518)." _Inc._ says "[<u>Micromanagement is a major source of inefficiency and frustration in most work environments</u>](https://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/5-ways-to-successfully-deal-with-a-micromanager.html)."

If micromanagement is so bad, why does it persist? At a time where companies monitor and quantify every aspect of employees' productivity, how can such a harmful practice survive?

Business journals and management books tend to focus exclusively on the psychological and interpersonal causes of micromanagement: anxiety, performance pressure, politics, and misaligned incentives combine to bring out the worst in managers. The experts say that with the right training, micromanagement can be avoided.

But this doesn't solve the riddle. The story falls short of explaining why micromanagement is so pervasive, even (especially!) at today's top-performing companies.

So I want to take a different path. In this essay, I'll show you that micromanagement isn't just a nagging habit; it's an inevitability. That's the paradox: micromanagement is both bad management practice _and_ a key component of the best management strategies. So in addition to explaining this paradox, I'll offer some lessons from similar paradoxical problems. In the end, I want to demonstrate that, with the right approach to micromanagement, managers and their reports can thrive.

## What is micromanagement?

First, it's important to clear up some confusion and misconceptions about micromanagement.

In _My Way or the Highway: The Micromanagement Survival Guide,_ Harry Chambers shares a survey of 261 workers on management styles. 79% said they had experienced micromanagement from their current or past managers. 72% said that micromanagement had interfered with their job performance. 65% said that they had considered changing jobs because of micromanagement.[**<sup>1</sup>**](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/the-micromanagers-dilemma/#fn1)

But how do you define micromanagement? The name itself is misleading: "micro" implies an attention to small-scale details, and "detail-oriented" is a very common phrase that shows up on job requirements and positive performance reviews. If attention to detail was all that defined micromanagement, I don't think it would be so universally reviled.

Instead, a micromanager is best defined as **a manager who is highly involved in the work of their subordinates.** This can manifest as controlling behavior, insisting on making decisions or producing work on behalf of other people — "if you want it done right, you have to do it yourself." It can also look like omnipresence, a manager who expects to be included in every meeting, on every email, and in every Slack channel.

It also might help to describe what micromanagement is not. It isn't manipulative. Machiavellian behavior like backstabbing, gaslighting, politicking, and prejudice is definitely bad management, but these behaviors aren't necessarily concomitant with micromanagement.

Most micromanagers have good intentions. They might not identify their behavior as micromanagement at all; if they can see the negative impact of their actions, they may consider it a necessary sacrifice for a greater good.

## The psychology of micromanagement

Management requires weighing tradeoffs: trading cost for speed, trading short-term benefits for long-term debts, trading concrete capital for intangible quality. A good manager can maintain the balances between employee engagement, hiring and retention, productivity, innovation, and profitability.

Micromanagement is just one of many possible tactics that a manager might utilize in pursuit of the right balance. We can think of these strategies in the context of a game between two players: on one side, the manager, and on the other, their report. At stake is the value that their work creates, in both company profit and personal fulfillment.

It might seem reductive to compare management to a game, but this thought exercise is at the center of one of the most practical innovations in pure mathematics in the last century: game theory. Game theorists see human behavior through the lens of abstract mathematical reductions — "games." The search for winning strategies to these games has led economists and politicians to breakthroughs in diplomacy and policy; role-playing moves and counter-moves was at the heart of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. **<sup>2</sup>**

Game theory has been used to analyze and optimize nearly every aspect of business. But while entire books, conferences, and even business school departments are dedicated to the application of game theory to corporate strategy, there are very few examples of how game theory can improve the relationship between a manager and their reports.

Game theory is the key to understanding the paradox of micromanagement and seeing the pathway to winning management strategies.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

If you've ever studied game theory, you know about the Prisoner's Dilemma. If you haven't, or if you're a bit rusty, here's a recap, as described by William Poundstone in his 1993 book _Prisoner's Dilemma_:

> Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don't have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain. **<sup>3</sup>**

The prisoners (call them A and B) choose either to blame their partner for the crime or stay silent. They have to make their decision without consulting each other.

Depending on their decisions, the possible outcomes are:

- If A and B blame each other, both will be sentenced to two years in prison
- If A points the finger but B stays silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison
- If A stays silent but B casts the blame, A will serve three years and B will be set free
- If A and B both stay silent, each will serve one year

Here are those options laid out in a table game theorists call a "payoff matrix." In each cell, the outcome is listed as "A's score, B's score".

Payout matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma. Scores are negative to follow the convention that a higher score (i.e., fewer years of prison) is better.

What's the winning play? **<sup>4</sup>**

The Prisoner's Dilemma is so commonly taught because it's one of the simplest examples of a "non-zero-sum" game. In a non-zero-sum game, the total payoff depends on the strategies the players choose. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, for example, if both players cooperate, a total of two years of prison are doled out. If one player defects, three years result; when both defect, four.

Compare that to a zero-sum game like chess: In a chess tournament, a win is worth one point, a loss is worth zero, and a tie is worth half a point. Your loss is your opponent's gain, and winning the most games always results in winning the tournament. No matter what opening, middle game, or endgame you play, the total points awarded in the tournament are the same. In zero-sum games, one side's loss is another side's gain.

In non-zero-sum games, both sides can lose — or win. For example, towards the end of the Cold War, the USSR and the US shifted their thinking from zero-sum to non-zero sum. Before, having fewer nuclear weapons meant losing, so both sides spent decades building up their arsenal, rattling sabers in a deadly game of chicken. But during the Nixon administration, the USSR and the US agreed to the policy of detente — dismantling their warheads at an equal rate, "losing" the game simultaneously. Without the threat of mutually assured destruction, both sides could afford to focus their resources on domestic economic and social issues.

Studying non-zero-sum games, researchers have made surprising conclusions about the nature of friendship, culture, evolution, and ecosystems. Counter to centuries of theories of evolution and "survival of the fittest," it seems that nature rewards cooperation.

## Why Cooperation Works

In 1980, Robert Axelrod, a political scientist, was studying the Prisoner's Dilemma. Axelrod's review of the existing research left him feeling unsatisfied: most researchers had only studied a few games at a time, denying players the chance to develop sophisticated tactics. So he decided to run a tournament, inviting academics who were experts in game theory (thus well-versed in the mechanics of the Prisoner's Dilemma).

For his tournament, Axelrod decided to use a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma called the _Iterated_ Prisoner's Dilemma. In the iterated version, players compete in back-to-back rounds of the game. At the beginning of each round, each player chooses a strategy (stay silent or blame their partner); then, the outcome (including the strategies each player chose) is revealed, and the next round begins. At the end of a predetermined number of rounds, the players' scores from each round are summed to a final result.

Fifteen people ended up answering the call. Participants wrote their strategies as computer programs, allowing for an unprecedented competition: each pair of strategies would duel an even 1,000 times over five consecutive round-robin rotations. The player with the most points at the end of the tournament won.

Axelrod set the payoffs as follows. Following a game theory convention, staying silent is called "cooperating" (since mutual silence results in the best collective outcome), and blaming your opponent is called "defecting" (since blaming a trusting partner can result in a bigger individual payoff):
