A collection of principles for making running better interview loops and making better hiring decisions.

### Apply the Secretary Theorem.

_TLDR: First meet an initial pool of candidates to calibrate on what great looks like. Then focus on hiring someone as good or better than the best candidate you've met so far._

The secretary theorem (the “37% rule”) is a simple guide for making a one-shot pick when options arrive one at a time in random order—like interviewing candidates—where you must decide immediately and can’t go back.

The apply it: first, just **observe** a fixed initial portion of the pool (about 37% of the candidates) to learn what “great” looks like, then **commit** to the first person who beats everyone you’ve seen so far.

This strategy maximizes your odds of hiring the single best candidate, which works out to about 1/e ≈ 36.8%. It serves as a clear, pre-committed **“explore, then choose”** playbook that prevents you both from settling too early and searching endlessly for the perfect candidate.

**What the theorem says:**

In the classic model you will see exactly n candidates in uniformly random order; after each interview you must accept or reject irrevocably; you only know _relative_ ranks so far; your goal is to maximize the probability of choosing the true best. The optimal policy is a threshold/record rule: skip the first r\\approx n/e candidates (about 37%), then hire the first candidate who beats everyone you’ve seen. This rule succeeds with probability 1/e \\approx 36.8\\%, and no strategy can do better under the model’s assumptions.

**How to use it make better hiring decisions:**

- **Decide your pipeline up front.** If you plan to see n=30 qualified candidates for a role, _commit_ to observe the first \\lfloor n/e\\rfloor \\approx 11 strictly for calibration (no offers), then offer the first later candidate who clears your bar (beats all earlier ones on a structured scorecard). This operationalizes “don’t settle too early,” while still guaranteeing you won’t chase perfection forever. 
- **Make the “bar” real.** The theorem assumes perfect relative comparisons—approximate that with structured interviews, anchored rubrics, and written “best-so-far” notes so the rule has something objective to compare against. 
- **Unknown or moving **n**? Time-box the explore phase.** When you don’t know how many strong candidates you’ll get, run a time-based observation window (e.g., first 2 weeks or first 10–12 interviews, whichever comes first), then switch to the record rule. Theory covers random/unknown N, but closed-form rules are rarer; the time-box is a robust proxy. 
- **Hiring multiple people? Use staged thresholds.** For k hires, generalizations (“k-secretary” and matroid secretary problems) use phased sampling and then record-style acceptance for each slot. In practice: sample ~37% of your expected pipeline, then fill slots with the first candidates who exceed the best-so-far thresholds, refreshing the bar as slots fill. 
- **Top-grade continuously.** Re-open pipelines on a cadence (e.g., quarterly for key roles). For each search, re-run the explore-then-commit cycle above; this prevents incumbency bias and steadily raises the bar without whiplash churn.
- **Know when to bend the rule.** If arrivals aren’t random (e.g., a batch from a top event), shift the observation window to cover that batch. If competition sets exploding offers, shorten the explore window but keep the “record” idea. The theorem is a north star, not a straitjacket.
